# Hi, I’m Kelly! 👋  
I’m a third-year Computer Science student at UC Riverside with experience in full-stack web development and applied machine learning. I’m passionate about building thoughtful, user-centered tools—and love learning new technologies through hands-on collaboration.

## 🤖 Interests  
My main interests are in full-stack engineering and applied machine learning.

- 🧠 Through **Break Through Tech AI**, I’ve been building data analysis pipelines and training ML models using tools like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  
- 📚 Explored NLP research by reading academic papers and experimenting with HuggingFace to deepen my understanding of large language models.  
- 🌐 On the web side, I’ve built responsive, dynamic UIs using React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS through hackathons and as a developer with ACM at UCR.

## 🌱 Looking for...  
Software engineering internships—especially in full-stack development or AI/ML—where I can grow as an engineer, keep learning, and contribute to meaningful projects alongside smart, kind teammates.
