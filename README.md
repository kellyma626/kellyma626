# 👩🏻‍💻 Hi, I'm Kelly!

I’m a third-year Computer Science student at UC Riverside with experience in full-stack web development and applied machine learning. I’m passionate about building thoughtful, user-centered tools—and love learning new technologies through hands-on collaboration.

## 🤖 Interests

My main interests are in **full-stack engineering** and **applied machine learning**.

- 🧠 Through [Break Through Tech AI](https://breakthroughtech.org/), I’ve been learning how to build data analysis pipelines and train ML models using tools like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
- 📚 I’ve explored **natural language processing (NLP)** research by reading academic papers and experimenting with **HuggingFace** to better understand how large language models work.
- 🌐 On the web side, I’ve built responsive, dynamic UIs using **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS** through hackathons and as a developer with **ACM at UCR**.

## 🌱 Looking for...

I’m currently seeking **software engineering internships**—especially in **full-stack development** or **AI/ML**—where I can grow as an engineer, keep learning, and contribute to meaningful projects alongside smart, kind teammates.
